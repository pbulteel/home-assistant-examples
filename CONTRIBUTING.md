# Contributing

Many, if not MOST, of the examples in this repo are from other people. I may have scoured the internet or chats and so on to find content to put on here, but it's work that others have made and shared. I try to include the name of the person who wrote it after asking them for permission.

If you want to contribute your own stuff or someone else's that you found and thought was worth adding, please create a pull request, and I'll merge it in. Please ask them if it's ok to include it. Usually, they don't mind and like to see the link to this repo. So many different configurations can make beautiful dashboards that others can easily use. Let's get sharing.
