# home-assistant-examples

This repo will have example yaml for Home Assistant automations, scripts, lovelace dashboard cards.

I've found or built different automations, scripts and lovelace dashboard cards that I think work well or look nice and I'm sure people are going to be interested in. I will try to include a screenshot, the yaml and some documentation on how to put it together and how to replace the sensors to fit your setup.

## Where did these come from?

The internet. I may be using some of these depending on if I have the components that are required. However, most of these are ideas or yaml that is provided by someone else. These are examples of things you CAN do with Home Assistant and therefore you should be able to copy them and modify to use in your environments. You then tweak them for your settings.
