# home-assistant-examples

This repo will have example yaml for Home Assistant automations, scripts, lovelace dashboard cards.

I've found or built different automations, scripts and lovelace dashboard cards that I think work well or look nice and I'm sure people are going to be interested in. I will try to include a screenshot, the yaml and some documentation on how to put it together and how to replace the sensors to fit your setup.
