# Reed aka Smart Home Solver showed an excellent Cheat Code automation

On his [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSojiNQH_4) he has an automation at the end that uses a cheatcode to enable the candy dispenser.

It uses the old up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-start-select key combination to enable a menu/option. It's at the very end of the video linked above.
