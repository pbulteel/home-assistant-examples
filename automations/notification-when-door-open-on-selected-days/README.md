# Notify when door is open on selected days

In this automation, you will get a notification when binary_sensors for the days of the week have been enabled. It works when both the day of the week is also the day the binary_sensor is enabled for. By that I mean, if the day of the week is Monday AND the Monday option is selected, then the automation will run.
