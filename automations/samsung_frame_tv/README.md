# Samsung Frame TV automations

I saw a post on Facebook for the Samsung Frame TV. It showed some automations to start the Frame application which displays artwork on the TV.

It also had some automations to start other applications. There's a list of IDs for the other applications.

You will need the Custom Brand Icon HACS add-on.
