If like me you have mistakenly brought a Fire Tablet 7" and cant return it, its pefect for a very basic HA Dashboard tablet. I have tried many differant layouts but this is the only way i have manged to get what i need in one place. The tablet is just too small.

This is what the layout would look like on you computer

This is what the dashboard would look on your tablet (sorry about the glare)
